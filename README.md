Home Page and Contact Page By: Fatima Farhat 
The homepage has a unique layout with revolving cards and a cube which displays our Logo and the slogan, Just Have Fun!  The vidoes from youtube and the instructors detailed instructional videos were the main source of our learning.  ChatGPT helped with the placement of the logo in the header via an Iframe tag. The colors were chosen for their subtleness.  The team members also contributed to the final design of the Home Page and the Contact Page. There insights were the determining factor in our overall design.

BlackJack Game By: Suganthi Ramachandran
To run and understand the game: 
To begin the game, click a number button on the game board. This button click activates the javascript connected with the button through event listener. As you continue to click on the numbers, everytime you click a number the computer generates a number and adds it to your number total and the code checks whether the total is equal to 21 or not. If the total is under 21, the code let's you to select the number and keeps adding. When the total equals to 21,the code prevents you to selecting the numbers by disabling the buttons and declares you won the game. If the total is less than 21, 
the number buttons gets disabled and declares you lost the game. If you want to play the game again, press playAgain which resets the board for new game. 
chatGPT reference places- playAgain button show and hide command(JS line 55 and 73),pre-line command(JS line 29), device response concepts(CSS styles).
